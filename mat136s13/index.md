    <h2>
      Welcome
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Welcome to the course web page for the Spring 2013 manifestation of MAT 136: Calculus I (Section 10) at <a href="http://nau.edu">Northern Arizona University</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      What is this course all about?
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      This course is a first calculus course concentrating on limits, continuity, the derivative, and integration. Applications are made to classical problems in physics and other sciences. For more details, see the <a href="http://teaching.danaernst.com/courses/mat136f12/syllabus/">syllabus</a>.

    <h2>
      Textbooks
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      We will make use of two different textbooks this semester. The first textbook will consist of a course pack called <em>Calculus I Lecture Notes</em> by J. Neuberger, N. Sieben, and J. Swift. The course pack is available for purchase for less than $10 at <a href="http://www.alphagraphics.com/centers/flagstaff-arizona-us634/">Alphagraphics</a>, which is located at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/OMde9">12 N. Beaver Street</a>. Note that the course pack is used by all of the MAT 136 sections. For our second textbook, we will use <em>Active Calculus</em> by Matthew Boelkins. This book is offered as a free downloadable PDF, which you can download <a href="http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/Download.html">here</a>. I suggest grabbing the PDF for Chapters 1-4, but you are also welcome to store the book in Google Docs. Also, we&#8217;ll be making extensive use of the Activities in the textbook, so it would be in your best interest to download the &#8220;activities only&#8221; version of Chapters 1-4.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In addition, you will occasionally be provided with other course materials. You are welcome to utilize other books covering first semester calculus.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I expect you to be <em>reading</em> the textbooks. I will not be covering every detail of either textbook and the only way to achieve a sufficient understanding of the material is to be digesting the reading in a meaningful way. You should be seeking clarification about the material in the textbook whenever necessary by asking questions in class or posting questions to the course forum.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Getting Help
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      There are many resources available to get help. First, I recommend that you work on homework in groups as much as possible. Second, you are strongly encouraged to ask questions in the course forum, as I (and hopefully other members of the class) will post comments there for all to benefit from. You can also encouraged to stop by during my office hours and you can always <a href="mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu">email me</a>. Lastly, <em>free</em> tutoring is available in AMB 137 through the <a href="http://nau.edu/student-learning-centers/">Math Achievement Program</a>.
