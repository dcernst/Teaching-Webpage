## Summary

There will be three midterm exams and a cumulative final exam. Each exam will consist of both an in-class portion and a take-home portion. Your combined scores on each exam will be worth 15% of your overall grade. The in-class portion of the midterm exams are *tentatively* scheduled for **Monday, September 22**, **Monday, October 20**, and **Monday, November 17**, and the final exam will be on **Tuesday, December 9** at 12:30-2:30PM. Make-up exams will only be given under extreme circumstances, as judged by me. In general, it will be best to communicate conflicts ahead of time.
