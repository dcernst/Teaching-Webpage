When doing your homework, I encourage you to use the [Elements of Style for Proofs][1] as a reference. **Note:** On each homework assignment, please write (i) your name, (ii) name of course, and (iii) Daily/Weekly Homework number.

### Daily Homework

The following assignments are to be turned in at the end of the indicated class period. I reserve the right to modify the assignment if the need arises. These exercises will form the basis of the student-led presentations each day. Daily assignments will be graded on a $\checkmark$-system. During class, **you are only allowed to annotate your homework using the marker pens that I provide**.

  * **Daily Homework 1:** Read the [syllabus][2] and write down 5 important items. *Note:* All of the test dates only count as one item. Turn in on your own paper at the beginning of class. (Due Thursday, Jan 15) 
  * **Daily Homework 2:** Stop by my office (AMB 176) and say hello. If I&#8217;m not there, just slide note under my door saying you stopped by. (Due Friday, Jan 16 by 5PM) 
  * **Daily Homework 3:** Complete problems found [here][3]. (Due Thursday, Jan 15)

### Weekly Homework

In addition to the Daily Homework, we will also have Weekly Homework assignments. For most of these assignments, you will be required to submit 2-3 formally written solutions/proofs. You are required to type your submission using $\LaTeX$ or Lyx (see below for more on this). I will walk you through how to do this.

  * **Weekly Homework 1:** Write up any two of Problems 1(a), 1(b), 2(c), 3(b) from [Daily Homework 3][3]. (Due by 5pm on Friday, Jan 23) 
  * **Weekly Homework 2:** Write up any two of Problem 4 from [Daily Homework 4][4] or Problems 1(b)(c)(d), 3(b), 3(c)(d)(e) from [Daily Homework 5][5]. (Due by 5pm on Saturday, Jan 31) 
  * **Weekly Homework 3:** Write up any two of Problems 3 or 4 from [Daily Homework 6][6] or Problem 1 from [Daily Homework 7][7]. (Due by 5pm on Saturday, Feb 7) 
  * **Weekly Homework 4:** Write up both parts (simple and positive) of Problem 3 from [Daily Homework 8][8]. (Due by 5pm on Saturday, Feb 14) 
  * **Weekly Homework 5:** Write up any two of Problem 1 from [Daily Homework 10][10], Problems 1 or 2 from [Daily Homework 11][11], or Problems 1, 2(a), or 2(b) from [Daily Homework 12][12]. (Due by 5pm on Saturday, Feb 28)
  * **Weekly Homework 6:** Write up both Problem 2 from [Daily Homework 13][13] and Problem 2 from [Daily Homework 14][14]. (Due by 5pm on Saturday, Mar 7)
  * **Weekly Homework 7:** Write up both Problem 3 from [Daily Homework 15][15] and Problem 2 from [Daily Homework 16][16]. (Due by 5pm on Friday, Mar 12)

  * **Weekly Homework 10:** Write up either Problem 1 from [Daily Homework 22][23] or Problem 1 from [Daily Homework 23][24]. (Due by 5pm on Saturday, April 18)
  * **Weekly Homework 11:** Last one! Write up both Problem 2 from [Daily Homework 24][25] and Problem 1 from [Daily Homework 25][26]. (Due by 5pm on Saturday, April 25)

You are required to use $\LaTeX$ or Lyx to type up your Weekly Homework assignments. To do this, I suggest that you use my [LaTeX Homework Template][29], but you do not have to. The easiest way to get started with $\LaTeX$ is to use an online editor. I recommend using [Overleaf][30] or the [Sage Math Cloud][31], but there are other options. The good folks over at Overleaf have preloaded my template, so to get started, all you need to do is click the link below.
