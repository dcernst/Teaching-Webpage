### What is This Course All About?

The beauty of Coxeter groups lies in the rich interplay between geometry, combinatorics, and lattice theory. Most proofs about Coxeter groups exploit a combination of methods. The methods that play a role include the combinatorics of words, the geometry of arrangements of reflecting hyperplanes (or the geometry of root systems), order/lattice theory, and linear algebra. We will begin our study with geometry, closely mixed with order/lattice theory, and progress towards an understanding of the combinatorics of finite Coxeter groups. With the geometric intuition in mind, we will proceed to study the more combinatorial aspects of (not necessarily finite) Coxeter groups.
